new 3D realtime RTP charts - in CDR bottom panel / active calls and in Dashboard (new RTP stat 3D charts). Those charts are using data from rtp_stat which are enabled for a long time. Those data shows statistics for RTP source IP streams sampled every 10 seconds which allows realtime RTP metrics before CDR is written to the database.
